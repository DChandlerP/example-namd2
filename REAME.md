# NAMD Multicore without GPU

Just a quick POC for a researcher that needs a multicore NAMD image without GPU. Apparently there's a module that doesn't
work in the NVIDIA image and it's [a known issue](0https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/mailing_list/namd-l.2019-2020/1186.html)?

The Dockerfile has comments that I hope will be helpful so please look there for more documentation!
